      "post : review =>  As a fan of baseball and movies this has to be one of my favorites in both categories. Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane do a fantastic job in their roles as Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. Billy Crystal (not to my surprise) knew exactly what he was doing for the movie and made it to be the best baseball movie I've seen since Field of Dreams (no offense to Rookie of the Year,Little Big League or the first two Major League movies). This movie made me like the Yankees for the first time in my life. Now if only someone could make a movie about the Pirates, aside from the original Angels in the Outfield. I'm sure there are movies, but let's get the biggest Pirates fan in Hollywood and have him make the Roberto Clemente movie...\n",

      "post : review =>  There have been many films made dealing with an individual who's outer appearance is completely at odds with their inner character. Some of these films are quite good but this is by far and away the very best. This is probably one of the most perfect films ever made. It succeeds on every level. Visually it transports one into a dark, grey, industrial nightmare of a world. It's within this world that we come to discover true beauty. It lies within one hideously deformed, abused and unfortunate soul who is being kicked around in this hellish existence. The screenplay, acting, direction all come together to create this extraordinary viewing experience. You really feel like you get inside this man and his tortured existence. The ending is one of the most effective and completely engrossing I've ever seen. Rarely does a film find a way to leave us with such a sense of closure and lingering fascination. The thing that really makes this film truly great is it changes the way people see themselves, other people and the world. I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen. There's a transforming quality about it. You only need to read the many other user comments to see how people were moved and changed by this film. If you haven't seen it, it's a must!\n",
